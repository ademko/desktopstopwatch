Intro
=====

This is a very simple stop watch for Linux. It has awesome start
and stop action, with a lap feature. I couldn't find a simple
application in the Ubuntu repositories to do this,
so I just made my own. 

How to compile
==============

Install wxWidgets and CMake, both of which are required to compile the application:

  apt-get install cmake libwxgtk2.8-dev

Then build it as you would any normal CMake applicaiton:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..          # alternatively, cmake-gui ..
  make
